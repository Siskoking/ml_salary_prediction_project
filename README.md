# ml_salary_prediction_project
Hi! 👋
This project is a small machine learning experiment using a salary dataset.

I trained and compared three different regression approaches to see how well they predict salaries:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

After training the models, I compared their error rates to understand which method performs better on this dataset.

The goal of this project is not only to get good results, but also to practice and compare different machine learning techniques on a simple, real-world problem.

📌 What you can find in this repo:

A Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and model training

A small CSV dataset with salary information

Model performance comparison using error metrics

This project was created in Google Colab and uploaded to GitHub for learning and sharing purposes.

Thanks for checking it out! YOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO
